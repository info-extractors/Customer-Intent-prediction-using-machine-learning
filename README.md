# Customer Intent Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict a customer's **intent to purchase** a product based on various behavioral and demographic factors. By analyzing customer data, the model can determine the likelihood of a customer making a purchase, enabling businesses to enhance their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that accurately predicts **Purchase Intent** based on features such as **Product Category, Brand, Price, Customer Demographics, and Purchase Behavior**.

## 🏗️ Features
| Feature Name | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **ProductCategory** | The category of the product being viewed (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Groceries) |
| **ProductBrand** | The brand of the product |
| **ProductPrice** | The price of the product (numeric value) |
| **CustomerAge** | Age of the customer |
| **CustomerGender** | Gender of the customer (Male, Female, Other) |
| **PurchaseFrequency** | How often the customer makes purchases (e.g., Weekly, Monthly, Occasionally) |
| **CustomerSatisfaction** | Rating of past purchase experiences (e.g., Scale of 1-5) |
| **Target: PurchaseIntent** | Binary label indicating whether the customer intends to buy the product (1: Yes, 0: No) |

## 🔍 Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Sources**: The dataset can be obtained from customer purchase logs, surveys, and e-commerce platforms.
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, normalize numerical values, and encode categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Convert categorical data into numerical representations, scale price data, and derive additional features if needed.

## 🤖 Model Selection
Different **machine learning algorithms** can be used for prediction:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**
- **Neural Networks (Deep Learning - optional for large datasets)**

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The performance of the model will be assessed using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

## 🚀 Deployment
The trained model can be deployed as:
- A **REST API** for real-time predictions
- A **dashboard** for visualizing customer purchase intent
- Integrated into an **e-commerce recommendation system**

## 📜 How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Train the model using different machine learning algorithms.
4. Evaluate the model’s performance.
5. Deploy the model for predictions.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Include **real-time customer behavior tracking** (e.g., time spent on product page, clicks, cart activity)
- Implement **personalized product recommendations**
- Improve prediction accuracy using **deep learning** models

## 📝 Conclusion
Predicting customer purchase intent helps businesses make **data-driven decisions**, optimize marketing campaigns, and increase sales. This project leverages **machine learning** to analyze customer behavior and provide valuable insights.
